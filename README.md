# Roomify


## Root file

Contains homepage, login and signup page (unimplemented other than gui)

- And basic file structure (subject to change)

## Project Documentation

**Contains all documentation related to class assignments**

- feel free to alter, they are meant to be altered

- I'd highly recommend to either highly comment on your code and/or create a document 
with notes on your research for how you want to do things on your side of the project
