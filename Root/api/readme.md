This file is where php files need to be held.

Index.php is the entrypoint for the php runtime

The following is a explanation for anyone confused

---
Here's how it generally works:

    Any PHP file you place in the api folder (e.g., api/example.php) will be accessible via a URL like https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app/api/example.
    The api/index.php file will act as the main entry point for all requests if you want centralized routing.
    
### Configuration Explanation

The following configuration code is used to deploy a PHP project on Vercel:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/*.php": {
      "runtime": "vercel-php@0.7.3"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/api/index.php" }
  ]
}
```

#### Explanation:

1. **`functions` Key**:
   - Defines how serverless functions are configured for Vercel.
   - **`api/*.php`**: Specifies that all PHP files located in the `api` directory are considered serverless functions.
   - **`"runtime": "vercel-php@0.7.3"`**: Indicates the runtime environment used to execute PHP code. The `vercel-php` runtime (version `0.7.3`) is responsible for running the PHP functions.

2. **`routes` Key**:
   - Sets up routing rules for incoming web requests.
   - **`"src": "/(.*)"`**: A regular expression that matches all URL paths, meaning any URL request will be handled.
   - **`"dest": "/api/index.php"`**: Redirects all incoming requests to `api/index.php`. This allows `index.php` to handle every request, which is useful for centralized routing or API processing.

### Understanding Serverless Functions on Vercel

Serverless functions on Vercel are a way to run backend code without needing to manage or configure any servers. When a function is deployed:

- **Automatic Scaling**: Vercel automatically scales the function based on the number of incoming requests. More requests mean more instances are created to handle the load.
- **On-Demand Execution**: The function code only runs when triggered by an HTTP request. Once the request is processed, the function is terminated, saving resources.
- **Ease of Use**: You can write server-side code using popular programming languages (like PHP, Node.js, or Python) and deploy it easily without worrying about infrastructure.
